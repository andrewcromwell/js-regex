# JS Regex

## What is this?

I'm testing out a regular expression in JavaScript.

It's nice to do automated testing, so I wrote some tests to verify the expected behavior of my regex.

## What kind of regex is it?

The goal of the regex is to help filter (i.e. remove) records which are:

* badly formatted, or
* not tagged according to some parameter

## How do I run these tests?

If you have NPM installed, just run:

```
npm test
```

## That didn't work
Try running:

```
npm install
```

## Where can I find this wonderful regex?
See operations.js

## Where are the tests?
See test.js

## I don't think this code does what it should
Then open up a pull request.

If you add the appropriate tests, some other programmer (me) can write the code to make the tests pass.
